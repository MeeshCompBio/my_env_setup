# My environment set up
A collection of script to make switching servers/going to the cloud a little easier. No root permissions required. 

Just run "my_env_setup.sh" and it will install the following
* Tmux (also dependencies needed to install)
* zsh (will be set to the deafault shell)
* vim plugins
* htop

## Notes
* Installation path is ~/.local DIR
* All software will be installed in a ~/Software DIR
* Add any bash aliases you want to the "bashrc_aliases.sh" file
* my vimrc script is not use in the install, it is there for me
